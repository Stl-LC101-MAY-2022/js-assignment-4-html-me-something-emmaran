               <h2 id="mainHeading">Meet Stanley</h2>
               <p class="intro">Stanley is an 8-year-old Shiba Inu. Many would describe him as “a good boy.” He has a soft, orange and white coat, with a contrasting black nose and paw pads. He's a bit small for his breed, but that makes him all the cuter.</p>
               <p class="intro">Stanley has all the perks of an energetic, loving dog with the laidback, unbothered demeanor of a cat. He spends the majority of his day laying on the back of the couch, staring out the window just watching leaves flutter in the trees. He could care less when meeting new people, and some days it seems he could even care less to interact with his roommates—but the rare cuddle lets us know his love for us truly does exist.</p>

               <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Stanley was adopted as a puppy in 2013 by his first human parent, Justin. In 2017, Stanley took on a new roommate, Justin's new partner, Emma. Stanley wasn't sure how to feel about this new human living in his home. Laying around the house, as he normally did, Emma would try and catch him for a snuggle—but Stanley would slink right out of her arms and find a new place to lay (keeping one eye open to watch her every move.) 
               </p>
               <p>It took almost a year before Stanley warmed up to Emma. After she consistently gave him food and didn't seem to be leaving the house, Stanley said “sure, I'll accept you.” </p>

               <h2>A Thriving Stanley</h2>
               <p>In 2020, Stanley noticed that his roommates were not leaving the house every day. They both began working from home, and he became confused that he wasn't allowed his daily alone time. While unsure about this at first, Stanley quickly began to see the perks that were in it for him.</p>
               <p>The primary outlet for his owners to leave was to take him for walks. Daily walks?! Stanley was in. When the lunch hour hit, Stanley would begin scratching at the door to remind his roommates of the time. With the click of a leash to his collar, Stanley would be on his way. Oh, the thrill of smelling the city sidewalks and marking all the spots as his own!</p>

               <h2>Stanley the Muse</h2>
               <p>With this new routine, Stanley felt like true royalty. His roommates were no longer going out with friends on the weekends, but instead, staying in to work on other hobbies. They did puzzles, played video games, and vigorously cleaned the house. Emma picked up her old hobby of painting. She painted all kinds of things—but given her primary interaction was with Stanley, who better to be her muse? Stanley was born regal, so of course he made for a great muse.</p>

               <h2>Life Today</h2>
               <p>While Justin's gone back to his regular routine of driving into work, Stanley and Emma continue to spend their time together at home. Stanley continues to thrive, receiving his morning butt scratches and daily lunch walks. It's a beautiful story to see how far they've come. Stanley's initial hesitancy of this human has now transformed into a relationship where he expects to share a pillow with her every night in bed. He loves his humans, and his humans love him. </p>
